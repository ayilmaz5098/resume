            <h1>
                Get in touch
            </h1>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm 27 years old. I have studied 5  years at Naval High School,(Istanbul - Heybeliada 2009/2014), and 2 years at Naval Acacemy (Istanbul - Tuzla, 2014/2016).
                In 2015, I had the chance to cross the Atlantic Ocean, using only windpower with a 99 meters ship left from  WWII, NRP Sagres, under Portuguese Navy.
                My navy years and friends will always have a part in me . 
            </p><p>After I was displaced from Turkish Navy on 07/31/2016, by 669th KHK, I have continued and completed my bachelors in industrial engineering major in ODTU-METU. My ODTU experience
                has also a big impact on who I am today by all means. I am just in love everything about ODTU, mostly people.
                </p><p>
                I have spent my early college years on actively programming on C, GAMS, JAVA, MATLAB, SQL but never got to use them in any real project.
                My late college years I leaned more into python programming, especially finance modules. Also I have tried, enjoyed but failed in both dropshipping and private label businesses.
                Now that I look back, I haven taken great advantage of my python work back then and I see that procrastination and disorganization are the two main reasons why I failed at them.</p>
                <p>Upon my graduation, I got into DefineX Consulting || Technology Labs as a business analsyt and worked in a project consisting of multi-stakeholders( Definex, a bank, an outsourced company by client) from different organizations.
                Being the bridge between both side of equation, has given me great insight about what is going on a project environment from kick start to production. I have learned so much in DefineX during my time.
                I devote that part of the paragraph for those people naturally.</p><p> Later on, I moved to USA
                for my MBA program in Massachussets and studied a semester in Cambridge College and completed a semester(12 credits) with 4.00 GPA. However, I was not satisfied with it. Meanwhile, I transferred to San Diego State University and took 6 more credits there
                in MBA but I was convinced that it was not for me. So I have dropped SDSU with a desire of following a career in
                blockchain industry. I am studying and learning this technology on a daily basis.</p><p>
                I started learning blockchain by open sources and probably followed the same path as most developers. The path of learning a new skillset through
                building something from scratch with guidance. Crypto Exchange Dapp that I have developed as is a capstone project that I developed with Dapp University. That product itself has given me deep understanding of how to
                write smart contracts in solidity, how to deploy them on a local blockchain by truffle / hardhat / foundry, how to write tests against and scripts in js for my smart contracts,
                how to develop a client-side application on react, how to interact with smart contracts through client-side application, state managenent via redux and react, extensive use of ethers, web3 js libraries, how to design and so on.</p><p>
                My current goal is to develop myself on hot topics like flashloans, De-Fi, NFTs and ecommerce Dapps...
            </p>
